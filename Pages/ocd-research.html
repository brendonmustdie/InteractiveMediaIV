      <h2>Ideas:</h2>
      <h3>Idea 1: Personal Survey</h3>
      <p>
        A while ago, when doing research for game design, I cam across an indie
        horror game that really horrified me (which not many horror games
        actually do). I can't find it, though I've found many off-shoots and
        copy-cats. The game is about a stalker.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's recommended that you play with a headset - so that the game can
        play the sound of someone walking through your house, and knocking on
        your door. It's a survey that asks you questions about your personal
        life, which become increasingly more concerning - asking about whether
        you lock your doors, whether you feel safe, what your sense of hearing
        is like, and who would miss you if you disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it could be fun to explore this concept using the added theme of
        privacy. People don't really think about what information they share on
        the internet and making a survey that asks privacy questions that become
        too intimate could be interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main concern with this idea is that it's not interesting enough - you
        can play 1000 versions of it on itch.io. When I shared this idea with my
        lecturer and her asssistant, neither seemed excited by this idea at all.
      </p>

      <h3>Idea 2: Obsession Simulator</h3>
      <p>
        At a previous Wits exhibition, I played a 4th year's "ADHD Simulator"
        game, which served to distract you constantly while you tried to
        complete the main storyline. I don't have ADHD.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I do have OCD. Through lots of therapy it's become moderate - but at
        one point was very severe. In this idea I would be simulating OCD
        through pop-up ads that prompt the user to do or fix something on the
        page.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the page itself, would be an article about ignoring compulsions in
        order to get better - which progressively becomes harder to read as the
        user scrolls down the page. Following any of the adds, listening to any
        of the prompts, and even hovering over some ads, would send the user
        right back up to the top of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lecturer and her assistant were excited by this idea! I do feel on
        the fence about it: I feels like exploiting a mental illness, in a time
        when people self-diagnose of these kinds of articles. I'm worried I
        won't be able to pull it off accurately, and I'm worried about coding
        pop-ups, as I don't really know how.
      </p>

          If you install Google Alarm, an alarm will go off everytime your
          information is sent to Google (spoiler: the alarm is basically
          non-stop).

      <p>
        I really like each of these references, but I think Doki Doki is the
        only one that really stands out to me as an artwork but I just have no
        idea how I would be able to pull something like that off. The main
        kicker of Doki Doki is that you've inadvertantly given the software
        enough access to your desktop to find the name you registered your
        computer account under.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think I could really achieve something like that without hitting
        a wall. I'm not interested in writing a whole story and I can't think of
        a way to get this to be internet artwork in the sense that I can't find
        a way to make it rely on the internet to exist.

        While Stalking and Privacy are connected, I think it's important to
        differentiate between them. So below are the privacy references:

          Multiple voice-AI programmes can use a few voice clips to impersonate
          you. Which could be cool for having the user's own voice play back at
          them.

          This OCD simulator focuses on "keeping thoughts away" which is
          sometimes what therapy for OCD feels like.

        A huge part of this project is relying on my own experiences and I think
        there's really very few resources that I want to draw inspiration from
        because it's really about explaining what OCD feels like to me. I'm also
        hesitant to include any of my ACTUAL obsessions because I think it would
        be triggering - not just for me, but for anyone suffering with OCD. I
        might have to slap a huge trigger warning across the front of my
        website.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find a kindling with ADHD simulators as well - as they tend to be
        about how hard it is too focus in your own head. OCD makes it hard for
        me to focus on things outside of my head - by constantly distracting me
        with one, or a few repetitive thoughts. So I thought I'd look at some
        other simulators.

      <h1 class="article-h1">Brainstorming:</h1>
      <h2>Decision:</h2>
      <p>
        I've decided to go with my OCD idea, pretty much because I think it
        resonates deeper with me and also because my idea is to have a page on
        my website where there are continous pop-ups that can't be stopped.
      </p>
      <img class="wireframe" src="/Videos/artwork brainstorm.gif" alt="" />
      <video src="/Videos/artwork brainstorm.gif"></video>

      <p>
        This is the only idea that I've brainstormed but I think it's the only
        one worth mentioning. I am going to have to go through some personal
        journals to find my most recurring obsessions to put them in the popup
        text - but I don't know whether that will come in to play for just the
        prototype.
      </p>

      <h1 class="article-h1">Technical Research:</h1>
      <p>
        I really struggled to conceptualize how to make pop-ups: that was really
        my biggest concern. I spent a lot of time on the internet, just trying
        to find one that works. I didn't really struggle with anything else or
        find it necessary to research it, when my main technical component is
        one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked into different kinds of pop ups - One of the key
        characteristics of pop-ups is that they open in new tabs. And akso that
        adblockers can stop them. When we go over to using React, I will find a
        better way to do this. But I decided to go for Modals, because they
        would cover the screen, the way I wanted.
