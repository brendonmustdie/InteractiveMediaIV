      <h2>Revision lectures:</h2>
      <p>
        This week's revision lectures were kind of hard to stay awake through -
        or focus through? I took a lot of breaks to get through them - the
        lectures were just really long. Not boring - I love code, and I think
        the internet is fascinating. Especially considering they were my first
        introduction to the year, I had a really hard time keeping up. It did
        definitely shine a light on javaScript to me - especially Mike's
        lectures, made everything make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the least weird way possible, I think Mike's brain understands mine,
        or at least that's how his videos make me feel.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love internet artwork! I think the definition is a little bit slippery
        to me, and I have a hard time grasping all the different definitions of
        it. But so far, so good - I really enjoy artworks that scare users. The
        way we use the internet right now is too lax for what's possible to be
        done. There are voice recorders that can impersonate you. Deepfakes are
        scary as hell. AI generated content changes the precedent of video or
        even photo evidence. Using the same password for everything puts you at
        tremendous risk - it reveals ALL of your information, making you an easy
        target for fraud, or scams.
      </p>

      <p>
        The internet is a beautiful, terrifying place. And I really love the
        versatility of the medium. I'm also enjoying how much the concept of
        "the medium is the message" is unfolding throughout the course. Every
        other day it resonates with me in a new way. I have yet to find an
        internet artwork I didn't like.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Park Design Principles for Interactive User Experience Through Net Art"
        really intrested me. The idea of interactivity in art adds so many
        layers to every artwork, both as an artist and a viewer. The section on
        collaborative participation made me think about this one South African
        artwork.
      </p>

      <p>
        WIllem Boshoff created "Blind Alphabet", in which he created 340 wooden
        carved objects, covering them in braille. To "view" the artwork you have
        to be blind, or have a blind person with you, who is willing to read the
        braille for you. It's an interesting role-reversal that requires the
        seeing to rely on the blind for descriptions. This artwork, which I saw
        in high school, was really my first introduction to interactive work.
        And it led me here.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I'm happy to come full circle with this reading, which reminds me of
        it.
