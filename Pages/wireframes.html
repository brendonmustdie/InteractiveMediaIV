        <h2>My Wireframes:</h2>
    <p>When these Wireframes were designed, I didn't have an artwork idea yet. During the creation of these, I went through the design elements I thought were important to remain consistent with, across different screen sizes. I also paid attention to readbility and user-flow. </p>
     
      <h2>Consistent Navigation:</h2>
      <p>
        The first part of my design process was to include constant navigation across pages. 
      </p>
      <p> The wireframes for this section were done in two parts: mobile, and desktop. </p>
      <img class= "wireframe" src="/Images/Mobile-Nav.png" alt="A wireframe describing the mobile navigation.">
      <p>In the mobile wireframes for navigation, I tried to focus on readibility - the convention of phone screen navigation is to use a burger menu, which opens a secondary navigation menu across the screen - which is what I did. If this wbesitre only required one other page (my artwork page) I would have considered just having one button to lead the user there but because the nav needed to take users to lots of pages I thought to leave it open.</p>
      <img class= "wireframe" src="/Images/Reg- Nav.png" alt="A wireframe depicting the desktop navigation">
      <p>In the desktop wireframes for navigation, I tried to think about consistency across pages. I used a header nav because of it's reliablity at being conpletely out of the way and also regular website convention. I think most of my websites do and will have this navigation, largely because it's an expected navigation and it's easy to read. I like the idea of having a side, sticky nav bar, but that does feel less professional to me. I'm sure for a personal website I would consider it - but I do try to present all of my websites as professionally as possible. </p>
<p>Even though many UI and UX designers have creative ways of changing website conventions, I think it becomes harder to use websites that don't follow conventions. So at the risk of being boring, I tend to try and play it safe. I think it's easy to excite a client with an impractical, creative design, but it's harder for the user to move through a hundred different pages that all work differently.</p>
      
<h2>Home Page:</h2>
<p>As discussed above, I like the idea of one button that leads the player somewhere. I always struggle with what to put on my homepage, and this is the first time it feels natural to me.</p>
<img class= "wireframe" src="/Images/Home - des.png" alt="A wireframe depicting the homepage design">

<p>On my homepage I want to influence user's movement to my artwork specifically. My artwork is meant to be the center of this webpage, and I want to lead the user there as early as possible, because that's what's important.</p>
<p>So I added the name of the artwork with the button that leads you directly there. I think the colour of the button and it's placement should lead players to my artwork. I also think I'll probably name my artwork a verb: the artwork is probably going to be interactive (for my interactive media class lol) and I want users to feel intrigued and want to participate.</p>
<p>I also use background images in all of my wireframes, planning for the pages. There will definitely have to be consistency in the background images, their themes and colour choices. I'm clearly a visual person and in a website full of text, the only way to really keep it interesting if through the use of pictures.</p>

<h2>Blogs Page:</h2>
<h3>Blog collection:</h3>
<p>I constantly run into this problem of not having wireframed my blog pages. So here's my fix for that.</p>

<img class="wireframe"src="/Images/Blog --des.png" alt="A wireframe depicting the blog page design">
<p>This is a wireframe of the page from which users can navigate to my other blog posts. I am VERY concerned about the concept of adding a search bar but I feel interested to learn how to do it in javascript. Again, the use of background images: I just felt that images in a grid is the least boring way to describe a list. If I'm feeling adventurous, I may even find a way to autopopulate these boxes instead of hard-coding them in with HTML. I was considering crating a way to sort them in javascript but it felt like a waste of time to me. I just don't know whether it'll be relevant for this section. </p>

<h3>Actual blog posts:</h3>
<img class= "wireframe" src="/Images/Blogformat.png" alt="A wireframe depicting the format for the blog page">
<p>
    There really isn't a way around the fact that my blog posts are going to be walls of text. I do want the text to be directly in the middle of the screen though, purely because I think it's easier to read it if it doesn't take up your entire peripheral view. 
</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>I enjoyed making these wireframes and I'm happy that I finally feel comfortable making these - because I know what I'm looking for and trying to create in these early part. I'm very excited to start conceptualizing my artwork and writing a rationale for it.</p>
