      <h2>Revision lectures:</h2>
      <p>
        This week's revision lectures were kind of hard to stay awake through -
        or focus through? I took a lot of breaks to get through them - the
        lectures were just really long. Not boring - I love code, and I think
        the internet is fascinating. Especially considering they were my first
        introduction to the year, I had a really hard time keeping up. It did
        definitely shine a light on javaScript to me - especially Mike's
        lectures, made everything make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the least weird way possible, I think Mike's brain understands mine,
        or at least that's how his videos make me feel.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love internet artwork! I think the definition is a little bit slippery
        to me, and I have a hard time grasping all the different definitions of
        it. But so far, so good - I really enjoy artworks that scare users. The
        way we use the internet right now is too lax for what's possible to be
        done. There are voice recorders that can impersonate you. Deepfakes are
        scary as hell. AI generated content changes the precedent of video or
        even photo evidence. Using the same password for everything puts you at
        tremendous risk - it reveals ALL of your information, making you an easy
        target for fraud, or scams.
      </p>

      <p>
        The internet is a beautiful, terrifying place. And I really love the
        versatility of the medium. I'm also enjoying how much the concept of
        "the medium is the message" is unfolding throughout the course. Every
        other day it resonates with me in a new way. I have yet to find an
        internet artwork I didn't like.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Park Design Principles for Interactive User Experience Through Net Art"
        really intrested me. The idea of interactivity in art adds so many
        layers to every artwork, both as an artist and a viewer. The section on
        collaborative participation made me think about this one South African
        artwork.
      </p>

      <p>
        WIllem Boshoff created "Blind Alphabet", in which he created 340 wooden
        carved objects, covering them in braille. To "view" the artwork you have
        to be blind, or have a blind person with you, who is willing to read the
        braille for you. It's an interesting role-reversal that requires the
        seeing to rely on the blind for descriptions. This artwork, which I saw
        in high school, was really my first introduction to interactive work.
        And it led me here.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I'm happy to come full circle with this reading, which reminds me of
        it.

      <h2>Revision lectures:</h2>
      <p>
        This week's lecturers put a lot of technical work into perspective for
        me. The description of API's made a lot make sense - I understand now
        why theu're so important and why they're so useful. I'm still not
        entirely solved on using them as often as I expected. I considered
        entering the DataIsBeautiful competition this year using API's and maybe
        that's on the horizon now, now that I understand how to use API's.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steven Mailloux's "Convention and Context" shines the light between the
        afformention in literature - he explains that conventions are changed by
        the real word in which they are interacted with and read. I guess it
        explains why there are different conventions for different genres, and
        also across different times. This is stupid, but I've started reading
        some of the books off my list and I'm noticing that in Russian novels in
        particular ("Crime and Punishment" by Dostoeyvsky and "War and Peace" by
        Tolstoy, specifically) have a different convention than most english
        books in the way of dialogue.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Crime and Punishment" more noticeably, has pages and pages that are
        just ONE man talking. English novels kind of require a back and forth
        dialogue. I'm rambling now but it's a little bit like this.
      </p>

      <h3>A Russian novel:</h3>
      <p>
        "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
        tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua." He said, "Ut enim
        ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
        aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit
        in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur." He
        downed his beer, "Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt
        in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
      </p>

      <h3>An English novel:</h3>
      <p>
        "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
        tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua." She said to him.
        <br />
        "Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi
        ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat." He laughed in reply, his eyes
        twinkling.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best point Mailloux makes is that these conventions are not neutral,
        and cannot be interpreted that way, because there are cultural and
        historical contexts for everything that gets read. Our understanding of
        "Crime and Punishment" is dictated by our context of, ironically, crime
        and punishment. Though the context that the author had, is different
        from ours.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why it's so interesting to read books written in different times:
        the conventions are reflections of the context that they are written in.
      </p>

        I spoke a lot about my connection with internet art in last week's blog
        post, but I'll ramble a bit more here, too. This week I started to
        really brainstorm for my artwork. You can find my brainstorming, prep
        work, and research
        <a
          href="https://brendonmustdie.github.io/InteractiveMediaIV/Pages/ocd-research.html"
          >if you click here.</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        I briefly mentioned a lot of my favourite artworks there, but I'll recap
        one:
        <a href="https://jamiedubs.com/googlealarm/">
          Google Alarm (Jamie Dubs, Google Alarm, 2010)</a
        >
        is probably the best use. I'm a little upset that I didn't think of it
        myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quick overview: Google Alarm is a chrome extension that will set of an
        alarm everytime your data is collected by google. It rings a lot.
      </p>

      <p>
        I connected so deeply with this artwork because it speaks to privacy
        (which is really important to me) in a way that raises awareness to the
        average user. It's really important to know what about you is being
        collected, and what's being sold. So you can analyze how many decisions
        you make are actually yours.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm going to get a litte philosophical about it and bring up the concept
        of free will - arguing among each other about which choices we make is a
        waste of time when a large portion of our choices (what to buy, what to
        eat, when to eat, how much to weigh, who to vote for, who to date, where
        we shop, when we shop, what we think) is controlled by ultra-mega
        corporations by Google. Thomas Hobbes and related philosophers argue we
        have absolute freedom - but how can we, when so many decisions are being
        made for us?
