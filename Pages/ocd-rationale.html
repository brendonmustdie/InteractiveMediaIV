      <p>
        Having obsessive compulsive disorder is like trying to scroll a website
        that continously pops up ads over the content you need in order to
        function.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was diagnosed with OCD early in highschool, but have been suffering
        with it for as long as I can remember. I've seen many different artistic
        interpretations of what it's like, some more accurate than others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to make an internet artwork that expresses my struggles with
        obsession as best as I can: by forcing users to experience one continous
        obsession constantly popping up over content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the pop-ups, I want to include an article about Cognitive
        Behaivoural Therapy (CBT). The idea behind CBT is that giving into
        compulsions reinforces the obsession - if you stop giving in, your brain
        gradually stops requiring you to give in, making it possible to function
        (theoretically).
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea behind using a CBT article is to make users understand that
        they have to ignore the pop-ups to get through the article - you have to
        ignore your compulsions to function.
      </p>
